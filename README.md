# Six-Sorting-Algorithms

Created for USM Computer Science CSC 413. 

This program was created for use of academic purposes. Feel free to use as desired bu please give credit. 

This is a basic c++ program to sort an array with 6 different algorithms. At start, the user has the option to enter an desired array, select an array from a pre-made list, or randomly generate an array. The user can then choose to sort by insertion, selection, bubble, merge, quick, or heap. The results will display to the screen and the user can then choose to use the exact same array with a different sorting algorithm. The display will print to a convenient txt file at close.
