# Six-Sorting-Algorithms
This is a basic c++ program to sort an array with 6 different algorithms. The user has the option to enter an array, select from a pre-made list, or randomly generate one. The user can then choose to sort by insertion, selection, bubble, merge, quick, or heap. The display also prints to a txt file automatically.
